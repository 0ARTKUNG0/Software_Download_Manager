# Download Performance Optimizations

## Overview
The download functionality has been optimized to handle large files and prevent PHP timeout errors when creating ZIP bundles.

## Optimizations Implemented

### 1. PHP Runtime Configuration
- **Execution Time**: Increased from 60 seconds to 600 seconds (10 minutes)
- **Memory Limit**: Increased to 1GB for large file operations
- **Input Time**: Set to 600 seconds for file processing
- **Socket Timeout**: Extended to 600 seconds for network operations

### 2. ZIP File Creation Improvements
- **Compression Strategy**: Large files (>100MB) use no compression for faster processing
- **File Validation**: Pre-validate all files before ZIP creation
- **Unique Names**: ZIP files use timestamp + unique ID to prevent conflicts
- **Progress Tracking**: File size information added as comments

### 3. HTTP Response Optimization
- **Proper Headers**: Added Content-Length, Accept-Ranges, and cache control headers
- **File Cleanup**: Automatic deletion of temporary ZIP files after download
- **Error Handling**: Better error messages for debugging

### 4. Temporary File Management
- **Auto Cleanup**: Old temporary files (>1 hour) are automatically removed
- **Directory Creation**: Ensures temp directory exists before operations
- **File Validation**: Checks ZIP file creation success before download

### 5. Apache/Server Configuration (.htaccess)
- **PHP Settings**: Server-level optimization for large file operations
- **Cache Headers**: Proper cache control for download files
- **File Type Handling**: Optimized headers for binary downloads

## Usage
The optimized download functionality works transparently:

1. **Single File Download**: No changes to existing API
2. **Multiple File Download**: Enhanced performance for large bundles
3. **Error Handling**: Better feedback for timeout and file issues

## File Locations
- **Controller**: `app/Http/Controllers/DownloadController.php`
- **Server Config**: `public/.htaccess`
- **Temp Directory**: `storage/app/temp/`

## Testing
To test the optimizations:
1. Select multiple large software files (>50MB each)
2. Use the "Download Selected" button
3. Monitor network tab for download progress
4. Verify ZIP file contains all selected files

## Troubleshooting
- **Still getting timeouts**: Check server PHP configuration
- **Memory errors**: Verify available disk space for temp files
- **Large ZIP files**: Consider splitting into smaller bundles
- **Slow downloads**: Check network connection and file sizes

## Performance Notes
- Files over 100MB are stored in ZIP without compression for speed
- Temporary files are cleaned up automatically every hour
- Maximum recommended bundle size: 2GB (depending on server capabilities)
